### The problem is that we don’t know what products the api will return when total>count. It might as well get us the same response over and over. If this happens, we may not be able to retrieve all the products from the api. One solution would be to lower the price range, thus lowering the number of ‘total’ to the point when it is less than ‘count’. However, there can be a situation when the app has  more than 1000 items with identical price. In that case, no matter how we manipulate the minPrice and maxPrice parameters, unless we receive new items every call, we would not be able to scrape all the products. So to overcome this problem, I would either have to read more about this specific api, contact someone who could know the answer, or empirically test how it works. One precaution that I think might help is the session object. Hopefully, the api memorizes the data transferred to me during the session and does not send me duplicate information when total>count. This should also boost performance since ‘session’ object keeps the underlying TCP connection.
